## You can always count on me when...

You can count on me when you have any technical or personal problem, your problems are my problems too.

## Where do the superheroes go shopping? At the supermarket !

When I was working as a bartender, i got the recipe wrong for a cocktail but any customer has realized that instead of using rum I had added gin. All this until a colleague of mine told me this, but now I have continued to do them the same way. And the funny thing is that some customers told me it was the best cocktail they had tried.


### My hair is my strength!
